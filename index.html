      <p>The hottest place in America in June 2021 wasn’t Arizona or Texas. It was Oregon.</p>
      <p>That month, Portland reached 116 degrees—hot enough to <a href="https://x.com/PDXStreetcar/status/1409287314870837253" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">melt power cables</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/29/1011269025/photos-the-pacific-northwest-heatwave-is-melting-power-cables-and-buckling-roads" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">buckle highways</a>. Sixty-nine people <a href="https://multco.us/news/2021-heat-killed-72-people-multnomah-county-most-were-older-lived-alone-had-no-ac" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">died</a> inside their homes, trapped in a heatwave so unprecedented that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36289-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scientists</a> called it “virtually impossible” without climate change.</p>
      <p>For Dr. Jola Ajibade, associate professor at Emory University and previously at Portland State University who grew up under the humid 80-degree skies of Lagos, Nigeria, the irony was unbearable. She had moved halfway across the world expecting gentler summers, only to find herself documenting climate collapse from her own living room.</p>
      <p>Inside her Beaverton home, the air conditioner gave out. The walls radiated heat like a kiln. “I honestly thought I was going to have a heat stroke,” she said. “I was scared for my family.”</p>
      <p>When she turned to <a href="https://screening-tools.com/epa-ejscreen" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EJScreen</a>, a now-defunct federal mapping tool once used to track environmental inequities, to track who bore the worst of that heat, the pattern was devastating. The same neighborhoods hit hardest by the heat were already burdened by poverty, redlining, and segregation.</p>

      <!-- ====== Context + Issue ====== -->
      <section id="why-this-matters"><h2>Why this matters<h2></section>
      
      <p>Public environmental data is what turns lived experience into evidence. Across the country, researchers, students, policymakers, and advocates rely on federal climate and environmental justice tools to make the case for cleaner air investments, stronger flood protections, and cooling centers in heat-burdened neighborhoods.</p>
      <p>When those tools vanish, so does the proof communities need to protect themselves and to have their realities reflected in science and policymaking.</p>
      <p>After living through Portland’s record-breaking heat dome, Dr. Jola Ajibade set out to understand why the same neighborhoods seemed to be hit again. In her study, “Disaster vulnerability hotspots in the Portland metro-region,” she used data from EJScreen to pinpoint where social vulnerability and disaster risk collide.</p>
      <p>The map that emerged traced familiar lines of inequity: Rockwood, Cully, and Canby are neighborhoods marked by poverty, single-parent households, aging infrastructure, and the long reach of redlining. These factors converged into what she called “resilience gaps.” Within months, Portland was hit again with a severe snowstorm and wildfire smoke.</p>
      <p>Her paper is one of 2,212 publications we analyzed at the Public Environmental Data Partners (PEDP) to understand how researchers across fields used federal environmental justice tools and how these tools shaped the work of those serving vulnerable communities. These studies—spanning academic journals, government reports, and community projects—used, evaluated, or cited one or more of five federal datasets. </p>
      <p>The Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) defines “disadvantaged communities” for Justice40 climate and clean-energy investments. EJScreen identifies disproportionate pollution burdens based on environmental and demographic data. Environmental Justice Index (EJI) ranks counties by their cumulative environmental and health inequities to guide resource allocation. FEMA’s Future Risk Index and Climate Risk Viewer project which hazards such as heat, floods, storms, wildfires will intensify in the years ahead and where. These archived tools are accessible at screening-tools.com.</p>
      <p>By late 2024, as the Trump administration prepared to take office, PEDP volunteers began archiving these tools in anticipation of their removal. The anxiety echoed 2016, when groups like Data Refuge and Environmental Data & Governance Initiative raced to save climate data during the last transition.</p>
      <p>In early 2025, entire federal environmental websites and interactive dashboards disappeared. The takedowns created a gap in public knowledge, especially for those using the tools to inform justice, research, and litigation.</p>
      <p>PEDP, a coalition of researchers, archivists, and policy groups, moved quickly. Working with partners like the Environmental Policy Innovation Center and the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative, they prioritized the tools with the highest public impact and greatest risk of removal. They mirrored datasets, rebuilt interfaces, and restored public access.</p>

      <!-- ====== By the numbers ====== -->
      <section id="by-the-numbers"><h2>By the numbers</h2></section>
      <p>Our analysis of 2,212 publications found that research using federal environmental justice tools began falling as early as 2024, months before the new administration’s executive orders formally rescinded Justice40 and climate programs in 2025.</p>
      
      <div class="flourish-embed" data-src="story/3400585"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script><noscript><img src="https://public.flourish.studio/story/3400585/thumbnail" width="100%" alt="visualization" /></noscript></div>

      <p>EJScreen, the most widely used of the five tools, peaked in 2024 with more than 350 studies, then dropped sharply the following year. CEJST followed a similar arc, rising after its 2022 launch before publications leveled off and fell in 2024. FEMA’s new Climate Risk Viewer and Future Risk Index barely had time to gain traction before their use declined.</p>
      <p>Even though the formal rollback came with Trump’s Executive Orders like E.O. 14148 and 14151 in 2025, there are several likely reasons the decline began actually in 2024. Late 2024 echoed the same anxiety that gripped scientists eight years earlier, when watchdog groups  scrambled to back up federal climate data ahead of the first Trump transition. That earlier “defensive archiving” wave of copying entire databases to independent servers resurfaced as agencies quietly froze updates and sites faltered.</p>
      <p>Even before any formal policy changes, researchers’ use of certain federal environmental datasets stalled. Disappearing tools and websites began to interrupt scientific work. For example, during the early 2017 transition, EPA website updates were frozen and some data pages went offline, prompting academics to hold off relying on those sources until their stability was assured. </p>
      <p>Users of CEJST, a Biden-era mapping tool for identifying disadvantaged communities, reported that the official CEJST site was becoming unreliable. Downloads and data access intermittently failed as the site went down in the transition period. CEJST’s download portal, for instance, began failing weeks before its removal from the White House website in January 2025. </p>
      <p>At the same time, the Office of Management and Budget memo (M-25-13) ordered agencies to pause climate-related grants during the transition, effectively halting hundreds of ongoing studies and community projects. This meant agencies had to halt climate and environmental grant awards pending review. The EPA and DOE both sent “stop work” notices to grant recipients in late January 2025, instructing them to cease spending on projects funded by Inflation Reduction Act climate programs until further notice.</p>
      <p>The EPA suspended 477 environmental justice grants, worth roughly $1.7 billion, while the Justice40 review process was abandoned midstream. In Oregon alone, 10 projects worth $88 million, including new Climate Resilience Hubs and pollution reduction efforts, were put on hold, with over $85 million in funds still withheld as of March 2025. One small city had to halt plans for a community center meant to double as a climate resilience hub because its $16 million EPA grant, awarded in Dec 2024, was suddenly “suspended” by the agency.</p>
      <p>There was significant turnover and upheaval in federal environmental justice leadership. The White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council (WHEJAC) was not reappointed, and nearly 170 staff in the EPA’s Office of Environmental Justice were placed on leave or reassigned. Without these institutional anchors, partnerships and coauthored studies stalled left unfinished manuscripts in limbo.</p>
      <p>Uncertainty about policy direction led some federal and state partners to hit “pause” on planned collaborations. For example, a multi-state MOU on coordinated environmental justice enforcement such as one between EPA Region 9 and California EPA was put on hold pending review of enforcement priorities. Federal agencies suspended or delayed certain evaluation studies that were underway – such as analyses of Justice40 benefit outcomes – once it became clear that the program goals were being reversed.</p>
      <p>Publication lag made the slowdown appear even steeper. Major academic publishers—Elsevier, Springer Nature, ProQuest—typically take 11.6 months from submission to publication. That delay means the apparent 2025 decline in EJ-related papers partly reflects studies caught in editorial bottlenecks, compounded by shrinking federal support and uncertainty about how to frame findings under shifting political priorities.</p>

      <p>XX% of publications clustered<a href="#story/3338466/slide-1"></a> on EJScreen and CEJST, unsurprising given they’ve been in place the longest.</p>
      <p>The newer tools <a href="#story/3338466/slide-2"></a> had smaller but notable footprints.</p>
      <p>One example, <em><a href="https://escholarship.org/content/qt7xw635f3/qt7xw635f3.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Climate Change Risk for LGBT People in the United States”</a></em> used FEMA’s Future Risk Index (FRI) to map climate hazards with demographic data.<a href="#story/3338466/slide-3"></a></p>
      <p>XX% of publications applied or mentioned federal EJ tools. Some used them for statistical modeling or geospatial overlays; others critiqued or adapted their indices to fit local contexts. <a href="#story/3338466/slide-4"></a> </p>
      <p>Among them was <em><a href="https://copi.helunahealth.org/assets/COPI-Technical-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Community Outbreak Preparedness Index (COPI),”</a></em> which applied the Environmental Justice Index (EJI) to track community vulnerability to infectious disease. <a href="#story/3338466/slide-5"></a> </p>
      <p>Topics varied widely. The top five are health, governance, equity, energy, and climate hazards. <a href="#story/3338466/slide-6"></a> </p>
      <p>Publications also come from different sectors and industries from health care to nonprofit organizations. <a href="#story/3338466/slide-7"></a> </p>
      <p>There’s also a diversity in publishers. The top five most occuring are ProQuest (graduate and grey literature), OSTI.gov (government repository), HeinOnline (legal databases), and commercial academic publishers Elsevier and Springer Nature. <a href="#story/3338466/slide-8"></a> </p>

      <!-- ====== What we heard ====== -->
      <section id="what-we-heard"><h2>What we heard</h2></section>
      <p>Federal environmental justice tools lower the cost of entry of doing rigorous environmental science by providing a ready-made, reliable data foundation. Without them, the cost of recreating equivalent datasets in time, technical resources, and money is staggering.</p>
      <p>“There’s just no way we could have done most aspects of our work without publicly accessible data,” Dr. Ajibader said. “Ninety percent of what we did relied on those datasets.” </p>
      <p>Updating and recreating national-scale environmental data like FEMA’s out-of-date flood risk maps alone would cost billions of dollars. Tools like EJScreen and CEJST integrate decades of environmental and demographic data into one platform, which allows researchers, advocates, and even students to analyze pollution and vulnerability without needing expensive software or specialized GIS skills.</p>
      <p>“Before tools like EJScreen, people had to build data from scratch or patch it together,” Ajibade added. “It’s time-consuming, expensive, and often not comparable across places. These tools let us work at census-tract and county levels without spending months and money we don’t have.”</p>

      <p>For many, these public tools are the great equalizer. They level the playing field between well-funded research universities and smaller public colleges that often lack the staff, computing power, and research budgets to build datasets from scratch.</p>
      <p>In 2023, the National Center for Science and Engineering Statistics reported that just 20 universities received over one-third of all federal research and development funding, while the remaining 640 institutions shared the rest. A recent analysis of proposed funding cuts found that public institutions would bear the brunt of lost research grants. When freely available federal datasets disappear, the burden falls heaviest on those least equipped to rebuild them.</p>
      <p>“Publicly accessible datasets level the playing field,” said one Dr. Ajibade. “At a public university, we don’t have the internal funds wealthier private institutions have.”</p>
      <p>These datasets and tools also shape how students learn and how early-career scientists build their skills. Across the country, professors use EJScreen to teach data literacy.</p>
      <p>“Replicability is a core tenet of science,” said Dr. Ajibade, who taught at Portland State University before joining Emory. “With EJScreen, I can show students exactly where to get the data and how to repeat the analysis—in Texas, in Florida, wherever.”</p>
      <p>Before it was taken down in early 2025, the EPA’s EJScreen Office Hours and Training Portal still listed upcoming sessions, including one scheduled for February 19, according to the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative. For years, these free workshops trained educators and researchers to interpret climate and equity data—until the site went dark.</p>     
      <p>Her students aren’t just learning code. “We don’t tell students what to think,” she said. “We give them the tools. They map cancer rates, toxic sites, vulnerabilities—and they see the injustices in their own communities.”</p> 
      <p>For early-career researchers, these federal tools bridge the gap between community stories and scientific evidence. Brandon Lewis, a doctoral candidate at Yale University, used EJScreen in his master’s thesis on air pollution from North Carolina’s hog farms. He remembered attending a North Carolina Environmental Justice Network conference where residents shared photos of themselves wearing masks to block odors from nearby Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations.</p> 
      <p>“EJScreen gave me a framework to link what people described—their health issues, the smell in the air—to quantifiable exposure data,” he said. “Without tools like that, it’s harder for communities to back up their experiences with numbers.” </p>
      <p>Federal datasets, he added, lend legitimacy to what might otherwise be dismissed as only anecdotes. “EJScreen was built by top scientists with state-of-the-art methods. Taking that away makes credible, community-led science much harder.”</p>
      <p>The power of maps to confirm lived inequality isn’t new. In 1987, the Toxic Wastes and Race report used national maps to show hazardous sites clustered in poor communities of color, visually confirming what affected residents had long known.</p>
      <p>The removal of these mapping tools erases that same power. When the EPA’s EJScreen website was deleted from public view under new administrative orders. The now deleted EPA’s EJScreen website, designed to highlight areas where residents face disproportionate pollution exposure, had become a cornerstone of advocacy and enforcement. As recently as 2023, the Center for Public Integrity advised communities to reference EJScreen data in discrimination complaints to the EPA, a strategy that community members successfully used to strengthen environmental justice claims.</p>
      
      <!-- ====== Kicker ====== -->
      <p>America’s disappearing public environmental data infrastructure connects science to everyday life. It’s an invisible backbone that helps scholars, journalists, and public officials see who is most at risk and what it takes for communities to thrive in the neighborhoods they live, work, and play.</p>
      <p>When Dr. Jola Ajibade learned that PEDP had restored those tools, she called it “a beacon of hope.”</p>
      <p>“I shared the (website) link with colleagues immediately,” she said. “Last semester we couldn’t use EJScreen in the classroom because we didn’t know where to find it. Now I can start teaching my students again with it.”</p>
